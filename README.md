## I don't own the GSA integration mod These images were not originally created by me but by the owner of Gameserverapp (Max). If you have any questions about the images other than how to download them (see below), please contact him via Gameserverapp Discord/email.

The PSD folder contains the project of each gem. PSD is an image format created with Adobe Photoshop. It is a format that can include multiple layers of images and various image options.

If you do not have Photoshop, consider using some of the following options:

- **[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/)**: You can open most PSD files, but some advanced Photoshop features may not translate perfectly.
- **[Krita](https://krita.org/en/download/)**: Opens PSD files, but with limitations in terms of full support for layers and effects.
- **[Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)**: Probably the most complete option, is free and online, as it is designed to be as compatible as possible with Photoshop.

These images were shared by Max in the official [Gameserverapp Discord](https://discord.com/channels/315049169071112193/1263085745862606961/1269698586761760840) I am uploading them here for convenience so that anyone who needs them can use them. I added additional gem icons for:

**If you want to modify any of them**, just **click on the green button** that says **<>Code** and then **click** on **Download ZIP**. Once downloaded, **install the Merienda-Bold** [font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merienda) **that is inside the downloaded ZIP** and **open the project with Photoshop or any of the alternatives** to work with PSD projects mentioned above.
